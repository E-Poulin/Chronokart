# Chronokart

The purpose of this Android app is to record statistics during a Karting race or training. It uses your GPS location to know where you are on the track.
You will need to click on the start button, and to go on the track. Then it will save your lap times.

This app was made with Android Studio, and I invite you to do Pull requests to add more race stats in this app :)
